#### Average Execution Time
- **MergeSort** has the highest average execution time at approximately **0.209 ms**.
- **HybridSort_3** and **HybridSort_4**, which combine **BubbleSort** with **MergeSort** and **QuickSort** respectively, exhibit higher average times than those involving **InsertionSort**.
- **HybridSort_2** (InsertionSort + QuickSort) shows a lower average execution time compared to other hybrid variants, in line with expectations given **QuickSort**'s efficiency in most average cases.

#### Minimum Execution Time
- **MergeSort** shows a notably higher minimum execution time, indicating that the best-case scenario is less efficient compared to other algorithms.
- Hybrid algorithms that involve **InsertionSort** (such as **HybridSort_1** and **HybridSort_2**) tend to have lower minimum execution times, likely benefiting from **InsertionSort**'s efficiency with smaller or nearly sorted datasets.

#### Maximum Execution Time
- **InsertionSort** exhibits the highest maximum execution time among all algorithms, which is expected given its quadratic complexity (**O(nÂ²)**) in the worst-case scenario.
- **BubbleSort** and **hybrid sorts involving BubbleSort** also show higher maximum times compared to other algorithms, reflecting the generally poor performance of **BubbleSort** with larger datasets.

#### Standard Deviation of Execution Time
- **InsertionSort** has the highest standard deviation, indicating higher variability in performance across different datasets.
- **HybridSort_1** and **HybridSort_2** show the lowest standard deviations, suggesting more consistent performance. This aligns with their design to leverage **InsertionSort** for smaller partitions where it is effective, and a more efficient sorting method for larger datasets.

### Expected vs. Observed Behavior
- **BubbleSort** and **InsertionSort** are known to perform poorly compared to more efficient algorithms like **MergeSort** and **QuickSort**, especially with larger datasets. This behavior is confirmed by the higher average and maximum execution times observed.
- The hybrid algorithms that combine **InsertionSort** with more efficient sorts (**HybridSort_1** and **HybridSort_2**) show improved performance in both average and standard deviation metrics compared to hybrids involving **BubbleSort**. This is consistent with the notion that **InsertionSort** is effective for small subsets or nearly sorted data, while **MergeSort** and **QuickSort** can efficiently handle larger subsets.
- **MergeSort** shows higher minimum and average execution times, which may be due to the overhead associated with its recursive nature and additional memory usage for merges.
- The results align well with theoretical expectations of sorting algorithms, particularly with respect to the efficiency trade-offs between simpler (e.g., **BubbleSort**, **InsertionSort**) and more complex (e.g., **MergeSort**, **QuickSort**) algorithms, as well as the impact of hybridization on performance.

### Conclusion
The findings are consistent with theoretical expectations of sorting algorithm performance:
- Hybrid algorithms combining **InsertionSort** and more efficient sorting methods show balanced performance.
- **InsertionSort** and **BubbleSort** tend to be slower and exhibit more variability, especially in worst-case scenarios.
- **MergeSort** and **QuickSort** retain their competitive performance in terms of consistent execution times, with **QuickSort** generally being faster in practice.

These insights indicate that hybridizing a slow algorithm like **BubbleSort** yields limited improvements compared to hybrids involving more efficient algorithms. Hybrid combinations using **InsertionSort** with a more powerful sort can leverage the strengths of each, achieving overall better and more consistent performance.
